abstract = {Catastrophic partial drainage of Pangong Tso, one of the largest lakes in Tibet, is supported by the geomorphology of the Tangtse Valley, Ladakh, northern India and cosmogenic 10Be nuclide ages of roche moutonn{\'{e}}es, strath terraces, and a flood deposit downstream from the former spillway. The former spillway for Pangong Tso is {\~{}}20-m-high and likely allowed {\~{}}18km3 of water to drain catastrophically down the Tangtse Valley over a period of about 2days sometime during the latest Pleistocene to early Holocene. The largest flood deposit, composed of imbricated granitic boulders up to 4.5m in length, is present {\~{}}33km downvalley of the spillway. These boulders have a cosmogenic 10Be exposure age of 11.1±1.0ka, the age of the outburst flood. The minimum calculated discharge was {\~{}}110,000m3s-1. One set of strath terraces, upvalley of the flood deposit along the flood's drainage path, shows that the rate of fluvial incision 0.3±0.1mmy-1 during 122-10.5ka increased to 1.5±0.5mmy-1 during 10.5ka to the present. The temporal overlap of this increase in the rate of fluvial incision with the main flood deposit suggests that the flood was important in defining the incision along the Tangste valley. A second set of strath terraces shows little change in incision, from {\~{}}0.6-0.9 to {\~{}}0.9-1.4mmy-1, sometime between 18 and 27ka. Roche moutonn{\'{e}}es, upvalley from strath terraces, yield a cosmogenic 10Be age of 35.8±3.0ka, defining the time when glaciers last occupied the Tangtse valley. However, the lack of glacial sediment along the Tangste valley suggests that the flood eroded glacial depositional landforms and sediments resulting in high sediment loads in the floodwater, which in turn increased fluvial incision to form strath terraces. Much of the eroded glacial sediment was subsequently redeposited as the main flood deposit. The catastrophic drainage of Pangong Tso may be the result of breaching of the Pangong-Tangste spillway during very high lake levels in a period of intensified monsoon (10.7-9.6ka) and/or possibly the consequence of seismic activity along the Karakoram Fault that is associated with the initial formation of Pangong Tso. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Bolch2011,
abstract = {Like in many other parts of the world, the glaciers in northern Tien Shan are receding, and the permafrost is thawing. Concomitantly, glacial lakes are developing. Historically, outbursts of these glacial lakes have resulted in severe hazards for infrastructures and livelihood. Multi-temporal space imageries are an ideal means to study and monitor glaciers and glacial lakes over large areas. Geomorphometric analysis and modelling allows to estimate the potential danger for glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). This paper presents a comprehensive approach by coupling of remote sensing, geomorphometric analyses aided with GIS modelling for the identification of potentially dangerous glacial lakes. We suggest a classification scheme based on an additive ratio scale in order to prioritise sites for detailed investigations. The identification and monitoring of glacial lakes was carried out semi-automatically using band ratioing and the normalised difference water index (NDWI) based on multi-temporal space imagery from the years 1971 to 2008 using Corona, ASTER and Landsat data. The results were manually edited when required. The probability of the growth of a glacial lake was estimated by analysing glacier changes, glacier motion and slope analysis. A permafrost model was developed based on geomorphometric parameters, solar radiation and regionalised temperature conditions which permitted to assess the influence of potential permafrost thawing. Finally, a GIS-based model was applied to simulate the possibly affected area of lake outbursts. The findings of this study indicate an increasing number and area of glacial lakes in the northern Tien Shan region. We identified several lakes with a medium to high potential for an outburst after a classification according to their outburst probability and their downstream impact. These lakes should be investigated more in detail. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},
