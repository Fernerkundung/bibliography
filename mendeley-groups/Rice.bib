abstract = {The current study investigates the potential of multi-temporal RADARSAT ScanSAR Narrow Beam B (SCNB) data to monitor rice crop growth and condition where special emphasis was given to the signature analysis of the crop. The study area is located in the Baleshwar and Bhadrak districts of Orissa. The temporal variations of radar backscatter of all land-cover classes were analysed as a function of time. The analysis of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter coefficient (sigma(0)) of rice crop shows significant temporal behaviour and a large dynamic range during its growth period, which is due to the interaction of microwave radiation with the crop canopy, increasing from the transplanting stage to the reproductive stage. This temporal variation of SAR backscatter clearly differentiates rice fields from other land-cover classes. Separability studies among different class pairs carried out using t-test and Bhattacharya distance show that all the rice classes are separable from each other except the early rice, which was mixed with far sides of hills and shadow. Knowledge-based decision rule classifier based on the temporal evaluation of SAR backscatter was attempted to classify rice and non-rice areas, and achieved more than 98{\%} accuracy in the case of rice class. The results are promising and confirm the possibility of operational use of RADARSAT data for rice crop growth monitoring.},

@article{Boschetti2017,
abstract = {Agricultural monitoring systems require spatio-temporal information on widely cultivated staple crops like rice. More emphasis has been made on area estimation and crop detection than on the temporal aspects of crop cultivation, but seasonal and temporal information such as i) crop duration, ii) date of crop establishment and iii) cropping intensity are as important as area for understanding crop production. Rice cropping systems are diverse because genetic, environmental and management factors (G????????E????????M combinations) influence the spatio-temporal patterns of cultivation. We present a rule based algorithm called PhenoRice for automatic extraction of temporal information on the rice crop using moderate resolution hypertemporal optical imagery from MODIS. Performance of PhenoRice against spatially and temporally explicit reference information was tested in three diverse sites: rice-fallow (Italy), rice-other crop (India) and rice-rice (Philippines) systems. Regional product accuracy assessments showed that PhenoRice made a conservative, spatially representative and robust detection of rice cultivation in all sites (r2 between 0.75 and 0.92) and crop establishment dates were in close agreement with the reference data (r2??=??0.98, Mean Error??=??4.07??days, Mean Absolute Error??=??9.95??days, p {\textless} 0.01). Variability in algorithm performance in different conditions in each site (irrigated vs rainfed, direct seeding vs transplanting, fragmented vs clustered rice landscapes and the impact of cloud contamination) was analysed and discussed. Analysis of the maps revealed that cropping intensity and season length per site matched well with local information on agro-practices and cultivated varieties. The results show that PhenoRice is robust for deriving essential temporal descriptions of rice systems in both temperate and tropical regions at a level of spatial and temporal detail that is suitable for regional crop monitoring on a seasonal basis.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between C-Band backscatter measurement on the physical structure of rice fields and its growth stages. The study is based on a ground-based scatterometer experiment conducted on rice fields at Sungai Burung site in Malaysia for the year 2005 growing season. Seven C-band scatterometer acquisitions at full polarization, namely Horizontal-Horizontal, Horizontal Vertical, Vertical-Horizontal, Vertical-Vertical polarization with incidence angle from 0 degrees to 60 degrees, were measured. At the same time, ground truth data for an entire rice growing season were obtained at 12-day intervals from September to December 2005. The dates were chosen so as to coincide with RADARSAT-1 image acquisitions. The paper describes the experiment and investigates the radar sensitivity to the physical structures of rice at different polarization and incident angles for different rice growth stages. Based on the result, a close agreement of backscattering coefficient between the scatterometer and RADARSAT-1 was obtained.},

@article{Zhao2015,
abstract = {Rice is a primary staple food for the world population and there is a strong need to map its cultivation area and monitor its crop status on regional scales. This study was conducted in the Qixing Farm County of the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China. First, the rice cultivation areas were identified by integrating the remote sensing (RS) classification maps from three dates and the Geographic Information System (GIS) data obtained from a local agency. Specifically, three FORMOSAT-2 (FS-2) images captured during the growing season in 2009 and a GIS topographic map were combined using a knowledge-based classification method. A highly accurate classification map (overall accuracy = 91.6{\%}) was generated based on this Multi-Data-Approach (MDA). Secondly, measured agronomic variables that include biomass, leaf area index (LAI), plant nitrogen (N) concentration and plant N uptake were correlated with the date-specific FS-2 image spectra using stepwise multiple linear regression models. The best model validation results with a relative error (RE) of 8.9{\%} were found in the biomass regression model at the phenological stage of heading. The best index of agreement (IA) value of 0.85 with an RE of 13.6{\%} was found in the LAI model, also at the heading stage. For plant N uptake estimation, the most accurate model was again achieved at the heading stage with an RE of 11{\%} and an IA value of 0.77; however, for plant N concentration estimation, the model performance was best at the booting stage. Finally, the regression models were applied to the identified rice areas to map the within-field variability of the four agronomic variables at different growth stages for the Qixing Farm County. The results provide detailed spatial information on the within-field variability on a regional scale, which is critical for effective field management in precision agriculture.},

abstract = {Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can be used for agricultural monitoring. In this study, three single-polarimetric and four full-polarimetric observation data sets were analysed. A rice paddy field in northern Japan was used as the study site; the data for this site were obtained using RADARSAT-2, which carries a full-polarimetric C-band SAR. Soybean and grass fields were also present within the paddy fields. The temporal change in the backscattering coefficient of the rice paddy fields for the single-polarization data agreed with the temporal change obtained for a rice growth model based on radiative transfer theory. A three-component decomposition approach was applied to the full-polarimetric data. With each rice growth stage, the volume scattering component ratio increased, whereas the surface scattering component ratio generally decreased. The soybean and grass fields showed a smaller double-bounce scattering component than the rice fields for all the acquired data. The results of this study show that multitemporal observation by full-polarimetric SAR has great potential to be utilized for estimating rice-planted areas and monitoring rice growth.},

abstract = {As farmland systems vary over space and time (season and year), accurate and updated maps of paddy rice are needed for studies of food security and environmental problems. We selected a wheat-rice double-cropped area from fragmented landscapes along the rural-urban complex (Jiangsu Province, China) and explored the potential utility of integrating time series optical images (Landsat-8, MODIS) and radar images (PALSAR) in mapping paddy rice planting areas. We first identified several main types of non-cropland land cover and then identified paddy rice fields by selecting pixels that were inundated only during paddy rice flooding periods. These key temporal windows were determined based on MODIS Land Surface Temperature and vegetation indices. The resultant paddy rice map was evaluated using regions of interest (ROIs) drawn from multiple high-resolution images, Google Earth, and in-situ cropland photos. The estimated overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were 89.8{\%} and 0.79, respectively. In comparison with the National Land Cover Data (China) from 2010, the resultant map better detected changes in the paddy rice fields and revealed more details about their distribution. These results demonstrate the efficacy of using images from multiple sources to generate paddy rice maps for two-crop rotation systems.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the tempo-spatial distribution of paddy rice in Northeast China using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We developed an algorithm for detection and estimation of the transplanting and flooding periods of paddy rice with a combination of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and land surface water index with a central wavelength at 2130 nm (LSWI2130). In two intensive sites in Northeast China, fine resolution satellite imagery was used to validate the performance of the algorithm at pixel and 3×3 pixel window levels, respectively. The commission and omission errors in both of the intensive sites were approximately less than 20{\%}. Based on the algorithm, annual distribution of paddy rice in Northeast China from 2001 to 2009 was mapped and analyzed. The results demonstrated that the MODIS-derived area was highly correlated with published agricultural statistical data with a coefficient of determination (R(2)) value of 0.847. It also revealed a sharp decline in 2003, especially in the Sanjiang Plain located in the northeast of Heilongjiang Province, due to the oversupply and price decline of rice in 2002. These results suggest that the approaches are available for accurate and reliable monitoring of rice cultivated areas and variation on a large scale.},

abstract = {A large-area map of the spatial distribution of rice is important for grain yield estimations, water management and an understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nitrogen. In this paper, we developed the Normalized Weighted Difference Water Index (NWDWI) for identifying the unique characteristics of rice during the flooding and transplanting period. With the aid of the ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model and the phenological data observed at agrometeorological stations, the spatial distributions of single cropping rice and double cropping early and late rice in the Yangtze River Delta region were generated using the NWDWI and time-series Enhanced Vegetation Index data derived from MODIS/Terra data during the 2000–2010 period. The accuracy of the MODIS-derived rice planting area was validated against agricultural census data at the county level. The spatial accuracy was also tested based on a land use map and Landsat ETM+ data. The decision coefficients for county-level early and late rice were 0.560 and 0.619, respectively. The MODIS-derived area of late rice exhibited higher consistency with the census data during the 2000–2010 period. The algorithm could detect and monitor rice fields with different cropping patterns at the same site and is useful for generating spatial datasets of rice on a regional scale.},

abstract = {Accurate and timely rice mapping is important for food security and environmental sustainability. We developed a novel approach for rice mapping through Combined Consideration of Vegetation phenology and Surface water variations (CCVS). Variation of the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) in rice fields was relatively smaller than that in other crops fields during the period from tillering to heading dates. Therefore, the ratios of change amplitude of LSWI to 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2) during that period were utilized as the primary metric for paddy rice mapping. This algorithm was applied to map paddy rice fields in southern China using an 8-day composite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in 2013. The resultant rice cropping map was consistent with the agricultural census data (r2 = 0.8258) and ground truth observations (overall accuracy = 93.4{\%}). Validation with Landsat Thematic Mapper images in test regions also revealed its high accuracy (with overall accuracy of 94.3{\%} and kappa coefficient of 0.86). The proposed CCVS method was more robust to intra-class variability and other related uncertainties compared with other related methods in rice mapping. Its successful application in southern China revealed its efficiency and great potential for further utilization.},

abstract = {As the Earth's population continues to grow and demand for food increases, the need for improved and timely information related to the properties and dynamics of global agricultural systems is becoming increasingly important. Global land cover maps derived from satellite data provide indispensable information regarding the geographic distribution and areal extent of global croplands. However, land use information, such as cropping intensity (defined here as the number of cropping cycles per year), is not routinely available over large areas because mapping this information from remote sensing is challenging. In this study, we present a simple but efficient algorithm for automated mapping of cropping intensity based on data from NASA's (NASA: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The proposed algorithm first applies an adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series derived from MODIS surface reflectance data. It then uses an iterative moving-window methodology to identify cropping cycles from the smoothed EVI time series. Comparison of results from our algorithm with national survey data at both the provincial and prefectural level in China show that the algorithm provides estimates of gross sown area that agree well with inventory data. Accuracy assessment comparing visually interpreted time series with algorithm results for a random sample of agricultural areas in China indicates an overall accuracy of 91.0{\%} for three classes defined based on the number of cycles observed in EVI time series. The algorithm therefore appears to provide a straightforward and efficient method for mapping cropping intensity from MODIS time series data.},

abstract = {Rice crop monitoring is an important activity for crop management. This study aimed to develop a phenology-based classification approach for the assessment of rice cropping systems in Mekong Delta, Vietnam, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The data were processed from December 2000, to December 2012, using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) in three main steps: (1) data pre-processing to construct the smooth MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) $\backslash$r$\backslash$ntime-series data; (2) rice crop classification; and (3) accuracy assessment. The comparisons between the classification maps and the ground reference data indicated overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients, respectively, of 81.4{\%} and 0.75 for 2002, 80.6{\%} and 0.74 for 2006 and 85.5{\%} and 0.81 for 2012. The results by comparisons between MODIS-derived rice area and rice area statistics were slightly overestimated, with a relative error in area (REA) from 0.9–15.9{\%}. There was, however, a close correlation between the two datasets $\backslash$r$\backslash$n(R2 ≥ 0.89). From 2001 to 2012, the areas of triple-cropped rice increased approximately 31.6{\%}, while those of the single-cropped rain-fed rice, double-cropped irrigated rice and double-cropped rain-fed rice decreased roughly −5.0{\%}, −19.2{\%} and −7.4{\%}, respectively. This study demonstrates the validity of such an approach for rice-crop monitoring with MODIS data and could be transferable to other regions.},

abstract = {Paddy rice agriculture plays an important role in various environmental issues including food security, water use, climate change, and disease transmission. However, regional and global paddy rice maps are surprisingly scarce and sporadic despite numerous efforts in paddy rice mapping algorithms and applications. With the increasing need for regional to global paddy rice maps, this paper reviewed the existing paddy rice mapping methods from the literatures ranging from the 1980s to 2015. In particular, we illustrated the evolution of these paddy rice mapping efforts, looking specifically at the future trajectory of paddy rice mapping methodologies. The biophysical features and growth phases of paddy rice were analyzed first, and feature selections for paddy rice mapping were analyzed from spectral, polarimetric, temporal, spatial, and textural aspects. We sorted out paddy rice mapping algorithms into four categories: (1) Reflectance data and image statistic-based approaches, (2) vegetation index (VI) data and enhanced image statistic-based approaches, (3) VI or RADAR backscatter-based temporal analysis approaches, and (4) phenology-based approaches through remote sensing recognition of key growth phases. The phenology-based approaches using unique features of paddy rice (e.g., transplanting) for mapping have been increasingly used in paddy rice mapping. Current applications of these phenology-based approaches generally use coarse resolution MODIS data, which involves mixed pixel issues in Asia where smallholders comprise the majority of paddy rice agriculture. The free release of Landsat archive data and the launch of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 are providing unprecedented opportunities to map paddy rice in fragmented landscapes with higher spatial resolution. Based on the literature review, we discussed a series of issues for large scale operational paddy rice mapping.},

abstract = {Rice is one of the major crops cultivated predominantly in flooded paddies, thus a large amount of water is consumed during its growing season. Accurate paddy rice maps are therefore important inputs for improved estimates of actual evapotranspiration in the agricultural landscape. The main objective of this study was to obtain flooded paddy rice maps using multi-temporal images of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in the Krishna River Basin, India. First, ground-based spectral samples collected by a field spectroradiometer, CROPSCAN, were used to demonstrate unique contrasts between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) observed during the transplanting season of rice. The contrast between Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) from MODIS time series data was then used to generate classification decision rules to map flooded rice paddies, for the transplanting seasons of Kharif and Rabi rice crops in the Krishna River Basin. Consistent with ground spectral observations, the relationship of the MODIS EVI vs. LSWI of paddy rice fields showed distinct features from other crops during the transplanting seasons. The MODIS-derived maps were validated against extensive reference data collected from multiple land use field surveys. The accuracy of the paddy rice maps, when determined using field plot data, was approximately 78{\%}. The MODIS-derived rice crop areas were also compared with the areas reported by Department of Agriculture (DOA), Government of India (Government Statistics). The estimated root mean square difference (RMSD) of rice area estimated using MODIS and those reported by the Department of Agriculture over 10 districts varied between 3.4{\%} and 6.6{\%} during 10 years of our study period. Some of the major factors responsible for this difference include high noise of the MODIS images during the prolonged monsoon seasons (typically June–October) and the coarse sp},

abstract = {The monitoring of crop development can benefit from the increased frequency of observation provided by modern geostationary satellites. This paper describes a four-year testing period from 2010 to 2014, during which satellite images from the world's first Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) were used for spectral analyses of paddy rice in South Korea. A vegetation index was calculated from GOCI data based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)-adjusted reflectance, which was then used to visually analyze the seasonal crop dynamics. These vegetation indices were then compared with those calculated using the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on Nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance. The results show clear advantages of GOCI, which provided four times better temporal resolution than the combined MODIS sensors, interpreting subtle characteristics of the vegetation development. Particularly in the rainy season, when data acquisition under clear weather conditions was very limited, it was possible to find cloudless pixels within the study sites by compiling GOCI images obtained from eight acquisition periods per day, from which the vegetation index could be calculated. In this study, ground spectral measurements from CROPSCAN were also compared with satellite-based vegetation products, despite their different index magnitude, according to systematic discrepancy, showing a similar crop development pattern to the GOCI products. Consequently, we conclude that the very high temporal resolution of GOCI is very beneficial for monitoring crop development, and has potential for providing improved information on phenology.},

abstract = {This paper presents and evaluates multitemporal LAI estimates derived from Sentinel-2A data on rice cultivated area identified using time series of Sentinel-1A images over the main European rice districts for the 2016 crop season. This study combines the information conveyed by Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2A into a high-resolution LAI retrieval chain. Rice crop was detected using an operational multi-temporal rule-based algorithm, and LAI estimates were obtained by inverting the PROSAIL radiative transfer model with Gaussian process regression. Direct validation was performed with in situ LAI measurements acquired in coordinated field campaigns in three countries (Italy, Spain and Greece). Results showed high consistency between estimates and ground measurements, revealing high correlations (R2 {\textgreater} 0.93) and good accuracies (RMSE {\textless} 0.83, rRMSEm {\textless} 23.6{\%} and rRMSEr {\textless} 16.6{\%}) in all cases. Sentinel-2A estimates were compared with Landsat-8 showing high spatial consistency between estimates over the three areas. The possibility to exploit seasonally-updated crop mask exploiting Sentinel-1A data and the temporal consistency between Sentinel-2A and Landsat-7/8 LAI time series demonstrates the feasibility of deriving operationally high spatial-temporal decametric multi-sensor LAI time series useful for crop monitoring.},

abstract = {Accurate and updated time series maps of paddy rice distribution and planting intensity will greatly improve our knowledge. Unfortunately, spatiotemporal explicit information on rice fields is relatively limited, and considerable uncertainties still exist as regards to its inter-annual variations in China. In this study, an improved rice mapping methodology was proposed through combined consideration of vegetation phenology and surface moisture variations from different seasonal rice. This method was applied to southeast China based on 500 m 8 day composite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhance Vegetation Indices with two bands (EVI2) during the period 2001-2013. Its efficiency was validated with 763 ground survey sites, with an overall accuracy of 95.02 {\%} and the kappa index of 0.9217. Spatiotemporal analysis indicated that rice cropping density and intensity lessened in southeast China during the period 2001-2013. Particularly, the paddy rice-planted areas reduced by 30.09 {\%}, changing from 231,005 to 161,484 km(2). Among them, the planted areas of double rice decreased by 49.34 {\%}, changing from 34,215 to 17,335 km(2). Therefore, averaged rice cropping intensity in southeast China decreased from 1.148 to 1.107. The primary dynamic patterns were from single rice or a rotation of rice plus other crops to non-rice (93,386 km(2)) and double rice to non-double rice (24,132 km(2)). When analyzed at provincial and altitudinal gradient levels, it was obvious that areas with greater rice cropping density or intensity were associated with more remarkable reductions. Graphical abstract The left graph shows that the rice cropping density lessened in Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan provinces and other three provincial-level administrative units (Zhejiang, Fujian and Shanghai) from 2001 to 2013. The middle graph indicates the movement of gravity center as well as the variations in the total planted areas of single rice, rice plus others and double rice. The right graph denotes that the rice cropping intensity decreased in each provincial-level administrative unit from 2001 to 2013.},

abstract = {The Canadian satellite RADARSAT launched in November 1995 acquires C-band HH polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in various incident angles and spatial resolutions. In this study, the Standard Beam S7 SAR data with 45??-49??incidence angle has been used to discriminate rice and potato crops grown in the Gangetic plains of West Bengal state. Four-date data acquired in the 24-day repeat cycle between January 2 and March 15, 1997 was used to study the temporal backscatter characteristics of these crops in relation to the growth stages. Two, three and four-date data were used to classify the crops. The results show that the backscatter was the lowest during puddling of rice fields and increased as the crop growth progressed. The backscatter during this period changed from -18 dB to -8 dB. This temporal behavior was similar to that observed in case of ERS-SAR data. The classification accuracy of rice areas was 94{\%} using four-date data. Two-date data, one corresponding to pre-field preparation and the other corresponding to transplantation stage, resulted in 92{\%} accuracy. The last observation is of particular interest as one may estimate the crop area as early as within 20-30 days of transplantation. Such an early estimate is not feasible using optical remote sensing data or ERS-SAR data. The backscatter of potato crop varied from -9 dB to -6 dB during the growth phase and showed large variations during early vegetative stage. Two-date data, one acquired during 40-45 days of planting and another at maturing stage, resulted in 93{\%} classification accuracy for potato. All other combinations of two-date data resulted in less than 90{\%} classification accuracy for potato.},

abstract = {Rice is one of the most important crops in the world; meanwhile, the rice field is also an important contributor to greenhouse gas methane emission. Therefore, it is important to get an accurate estimation of rice acreage for both food production and climate change related studies. The eastern plain region is one of the major single-cropped rice (SCR) growing areas in China. Subjected to the topography and intensified human activities, the rice fields are generally fragmented and irregular. How remote sensing can meet this challenge to accurately estimate the acreage of the rice in this region using medium-resolution imagery is the topic of this study. In this study, the applicability of the Chinese HJ-1A/B satellites and a two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) was investigated. Field campaigns were carried out during the rice growing season and ground-truth data were collected for classification accuracy assessments in 2012. A stepwise classification strategy utilizing the EVI2 signatures during key phenology stages, i.e., the transplanting and the vegetative to reproductive transition phases, of the SCR was proposed, and the overall classification accuracy was 91.7{\%}. The influence of the mixed pixel and boundary effects to classification accuracy was also investigated. This work demonstrates that the Chinese HJ-1A/B data are suitable data source to estimating SCR cropping area under complex land cover composition.},

abstract = {Changes in rice cultivation systems have been observed in the Mekong River Delta, Vietnam. Among the changes in cultural practices, the change from transplanting to direct sowing, the use of water-saving technology, and the use of high production method could have impacts on radar remote sensing methods previously developed for rice monitoring. Using Envisat (Environmental Satellite) ASAR (Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar) data over the province of An Giang, this study showed that the radar backscattering behaviour is much different from that of the reported traditional rice. At the early stage of the season, direct sowing on fields with rough and wet soil surface provides very high backscatter values for HH (Horizontal transmit - Horizontal receive polarisation) and VV (Vertical transmit - Vertical receive polarisation) data, as a contrast compared to the very low backscatter of fields covered with water before emergence. The temporal increase of the backscatter is therefore not observed clearly over direct sowing fields. Hence, the use of the intensity temporal change as a rice classifier proposed previously may not apply. Due to the drainage that occurs during the season, HH, VV and HH/VV are not strongly related to biomass, in contrast with past results. However, HH/VV ratio could be used to derive the rice/non-rice classification algorithm for all conditions of rice fields in the test province. The mapping results using the HH/VV polarization ratio at a single date in the middle period of the rice season were assessed using statistical data at different districts in the province, where very high accuracy was found. The method can be applied to other regions, provided that the synthetic aperture radar data are acquired during the peak period of the rice season, and that few training fields provide adjusted threshold values used in the method.},

abstract = {Numerous sources provide evidence of trends and patterns in average farm size and farmland distribution worldwide, but they often lack documentation, are in some cases out of date, and do not provide comprehensive global and comparative regional estimates. This article uses agricultural census data (provided at the country level in Web Appendix) to show that there are more than 570 million farms worldwide, most of which are small and family-operated. It shows that small farms (less than 2 ha) operate about 12{\%} and family farms about 75{\%} of the world's agricultural land. It shows that average farm size decreased in most low- and lower-middle-income countries for which data are available from 1960 to 2000, whereas average farm sizes increased from 1960 to 2000 in some upper-middle-income countries and in nearly all high-income countries for which we have information. Such estimates help inform agricultural development strategies, although the estimates are limited by the data available. Continued efforts to enhance the collection and dissemination of up-to date, comprehensive, and more standardized agricultural census data, including at the farm and national level, are essential to having a more representative picture of the number of farms, small farms, and family farms as well as changes in farm size and farmland distribution worldwide.},

abstract = {Rice crop is one of the most important agricultural products in Asia. It is necessary to monitor rice in wide area for the food control and the adjustment of food. This study focuses on the validation for monitoring of rice crop growth and extraction of rice-planted area using the German TerraSAR-X (X-band), ENVISAT-1/ASAR (C-band) and ALOS/PALSAR (L-band). TerraSAR-X is an advanced satellite which is able to observe 1m resolution with single polarization (HH or VV) or 2m resolution with dual polarization (HH/VV) in SpotLight mode. Also ASAR and PALSAR have single and dual polarization mode. Multi-temporal SAR data of each satellite are processed and analyzed to investigate temporal change of SAR backscattering coefficient of rice-planted area during the rice growing cycle with different wavelength, polarization and resolution in the test site of Hiroshima, Japan. Ground truth data are measured simultaneously with satellite observation such as height of plant, vegetation cover and Leaf Area Index (LAI) corresponding to SAR observation, and also the correlation between SAR backscattering coefficient and those parameters of rice crop growing were analyzed. SAR backscatter shows the significant change in early stage of rice growing cycle. Therefore, rice-planted area extraction is conducted with multi-temporal SAR data based on a classification technique using maximum likelihood method (MLC). In conclusion, rice crop growth and rice-planted area extraction can be successfully monitored using multi-temporal and multi-wavelength SAR data.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the interaction between microwave backscatter signatures and rice canopy growth variables, as well as to provide definitive insight into the interaction between backscatter and vegetation based on a comprehensive data set collected under the unique crop conditions of paddy rice (background is water surface). Our unique data consisted of daily microwave backscattering coefficients at all combinations of five frequencies (Ka, Ku, X, C, and L), all polarizations (HH, VH, HV, and VV), and four incident angles (25??, 35??, 45??, and 55??) for the entire rice crop period, from before transplantation until postharvest cultivation. A wide range of plant variables, such as leaf area index (LAI), and biomass of the whole plant and plant parts were measured periodically throughout the season. Analyses based on statistical correlation and a simple backscatter process model (the water cloud model) showed that LAI was best correlated with HH- and cross-polarization of the C-band, while fresh biomass was best correlated with HH- and cross-polarization of the L-band. Contrarily, the higher frequency bands (Ka, Ku, and X) were poorly correlated with LAI and biomass. Interestingly, the weight of heads (ultimately the grain yield) was highly correlated with the backscattering coefficient of the Ka- and Ku-bands, while the others were poorly correlated. The simple scattering process model may be applicable for C- and L-bands in rice canopies, while it may not be suitable for Ka- and Ku-bands. In the model, LAI was a better canopy descriptor for the C-band, while total fresh biomass was a better canopy descriptor for the L-band. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Accurate and up-to-date information on the spatial distribution of paddy rice fields is necessary for the studies of trace gas emissions, water source management, and food security. The phenology-based paddy rice mapping algorithm, which identifies the unique flooding stage of paddy rice, has been widely used. However, identification and mapping of paddy rice in rice-wetland coexistent areas is still a challenging task. In this study, we found that the flooding/transplanting periods of paddy rice and natural wetlands were different. The natural wetlands flood earlier and have a shorter duration than paddy rice in the Panjin Plain, a temperate region in China. We used this asynchronous flooding stage to extract the paddy rice planting area from the rice-wetland coexistent area. MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data was used to derive the temperature-defined plant growing season. Landsat 8 OLI imagery was used to detect the flooding signal and then paddy rice was extracted using the difference in flooding stages between paddy rice and natural wetlands. The resultant paddy rice map was evaluated with in-situ ground-truth data and Google Earth images. The estimated overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were 95{\%} and 0.90, respectively. The spatial pattern of OLI-derived paddy rice map agrees well with the paddy rice layer from the National Land Cover Dataset from 2010 (NLCD-2010). The differences between RiceLandsat and RiceNLCD are in the range of ±20{\%} for most 1-km grid cell. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of the phenology-based paddy rice mapping algorithm, via integrating MODIS and Landsat 8 OLI images, to map paddy rice fields in complex landscapes of paddy rice and natural wetland in the temperate region.},

abstract = {Asian countries strongly depend on rice production for food security. The major rice-growing season (June to October) is highly exposed to the risk of tropical storm related damage. Unbiased and transparent approaches to assess the risk of rice crop damage are essential to support mitigation and disaster response strategies in the region. This study describes and demonstrates a method for rapid, pre-event crop status assessment. The ex-post test case is Typhoon Haiyan and its impact on the rice crop in Leyte Province in the Philippines. A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) derived rice area map was used to delineate the area at risk while crop status at the moment of typhoon landfall was estimated from specific time series analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. A spatially explicit indicator of risk of standing crop loss was calculated as the time between estimated heading date and typhoon occurrence. Results of the analysis of pre- and post-event SAR images showed that 6500 ha were flooded in northeastern Leyte. This area was also the region most at risk to storm related crop damage due to late establishment of rice. Estimates highlight that about 700 ha of rice (71{\%} of which was in northeastern Leyte) had not reached maturity at the time of the typhoon event and a further 8400 ha (84{\%} of which was in northeastern Leyte) were likely to be not yet harvested. We demonstrated that the proposed approach can provide pre-event, in-season information on the status of rice and other field crops and the risk of damage posed by tropical storms.},

abstract = {Rice is a major food supply in southeast China. With increased population and urbanization, reliable rice mapping is critical in this region. Because of frequent cloud cover and precipitation during the rice-growing season, it is difficult to conduct large-area rice monitoring with optical remote sensing techniques. L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR), with its all-weather day and night imaging and canopy penetration capabilities, provides a unique alternative. In this study, a first-order radiative transfer model was developed to simulate L-band scattering properties of paddy rice. Three Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)/Phased-Array-Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) images in dual-polarization mode (HH and HV) acquired in early tillering (June 28, 2007), tillering (August 13, 2007), and heading (September 28, 2007) stages were processed to test the temporal variation of rice backscatter. It was found that plant height and leaf mass amount were the two major structural parameters that contributed to rice backscatter in PALSAR images. The variation of the simulated HH backscatter matched with PALSAR observations in sample fields, although the simulated backscatter coefficients were around 3 dB lower than image-extracted values. Leaf volume scattering and leaf-ground double bounce were found as the two major scattering components in L-band HH polarization and increased with leaf layer height and density. This paper demonstrated that L-band HH backscatter was more sensitive to rice's structural variation than the VV backscatter and may therefore be more useful in rice mapping and modeling studies.},

@article{Yan2014,
abstract = {Double- and triple-cropping in a year have played a very important role in meeting the rising need for food in China. However, the intensified agricultural practices have significantly altered biogeochemical cycles and soil quality. Understanding and mapping cropping intensity in China's agricultural systems are therefore necessary to better estimate carbon, nitrogen and water fluxes within agro-ecosystems on the national scale. In this study, we investigated the spatial pattern of crop calendar and multiple cropping rotations in China using phenological records from 394 agro-meteorological stations (AMSs) across China. The results from the analysis of in situ field observations were used to develop a new algorithm that identifies the spatial distribution of multiple cropping in China from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series data with a 500 m spatial resolution and an 8-day temporal resolution. According to the MODIS-derived multiple cropping distribution in 2002, the proportion of cropland cultivated with multiple crops reached 34{\%} in China. Double-cropping accounted for approximately 94.6{\%} and triple-cropping for 5.4{\%}. The results demonstrat that MODIS EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) time series data have the capability and potential to delineate the dynamics of double- and triple-cropping practices. The resultant multiple cropping map could be used to evaluate the impacts of agricultural intensification on biogeochemical cycles.},
