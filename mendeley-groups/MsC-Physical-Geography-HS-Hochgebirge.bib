abstract = {Field data on the rates of solifluction and associated parameters are compiled from the literature, in an attempt to evaluate factors controlling the spatial variability in solifluctionprocesses and landforms, with special attention on the climate–solifluction relationship. The analyzed data originate from 46 sites over a wide range of periglacial environments, from Antarctic nunataks to tropical high mountains. Solifluction, broadly defined as slow mass wasting resulting from freeze–thaw action in fine-textured soils, involves several components: needle ice creep and diurnal frost creep originating from diurnal freeze–thaw action; annual frost creep, gelifluction and plug-like flow originating from annual freeze–thaw action; and retrograde movement caused by soil cohesion. The depth and thickness of ice lenses and freeze–thaw frequency are the major controls on the spatial variation in solifluctionprocesses. Near the warm margin of the solifluction-affected environment, diurnal freeze–thaw action induces shallow but relatively rapid movement of a superficial layer 5–10 cm thick on average, often creating the thin stone-banked lobes typically seen on tropical high mountains. In addition to diurnal movement, annual frost creep and gelifluction may occur on slopes with soil climates of seasonal frost to warm permafrost, dislocating a soil layer shallower than 60 cm at a rate of centimeters per year and eventually producing medium-size solifluction lobes. In High-Arctic cold permafrost regions, two-sided freezing can induce plug-like flow of a soil mass 60 cm or thicker. The correlation between process and landform suggests that the riser height of lobes is indicative of the maximum depth of movement and prevailing freeze–thaw type. Climate change may result in new different ground freezing conditions, thereby influencing the surface velocity and maximum depth of soil movement. Soil moisture and topography also control solifluction. High moisture availability in the seasonal freezing period enhances diurnal freeze–thaw action and subsequent seasonal frost heaving. The latter contributes to raising the moisture content of the thawed layer and promotes gelifluction during the thawing period. The slope angle defines the upper limit of the surface velocity of solifluction. A diagram correlating the potential frost creep with the actual surface velocity permits an inter-site comparison of the relative magnitude of solifluction components. Physically based modelling of periglacial slope evolution requires synthetic and more detailed field monitoring and laboratory simulations of solifluctionprocesses.},

abstract = {Rockfall activity during thawing periods was investigated by collecting rockfall debris fallen on the snow-covered talus slope in a cirque in the Japanese Alps. Near-surface rock temperature was also monitored on the cirque wall. Maximum rockfall activity occurs on average about 10 days after the meltout of the cirque wall. The intensive activity is rarely associated with precipitation events or diurnal frost cycles on the rockface. A thermal conduction model suggests that rockfalls at this site occur most frequently when the seasonal thawing front penetrates to a depth of about 1 m in the bedrock. While the freeze–thaw penetration controls the maximum dimensions of detachable rock mass, joint spacing on the rockface affects the size distribution of rockfall debris. Boulder falls resulting from seasonal frost weathering are considered to be the most important process responsible for the contemporary modification of the cirque wall. The rockfall volume during a thawing period is usually 1–3 m3, which is equivalent to the rate of cirque wall retreat of the order of 0.01 mm year−1. However, big boulder falls that occur once per decade can increase the retreat rate significantly.},

abstract = {Changes in temperature and precipitation have a range of impacts, including change of glacier extent, extent and duration of snow cover, and distribution and thermal properties of permafrost. Similarly, it is likely that climatic changes affect frequency and magnitude of mass movements, such as shallow landslides, debris flows, rock slope failures, or ice avalanches. However, so far changes in mass-movement activity can hardly be detected in observational records. In this progress report we document the role of climate variability and change on mass-movement processes in mountains through the description and analysis of selected, recent mass movements where effects of global warming and the occurrence of heavy precipitation are thought to have contributed to, or triggered, events. In addition, we assess possible effects of future climatic changes on the incidence of mass-movement processes. The report concentrates on high-mountain systems, including processes such as glacier downwasting and the formation of new ice-marginal lakes, glacier debuttressing and the occurrence of rock slope instability, temperature increase and permafrost degradation, as well as on changing sediment reservoirs and sediment supply, with a clear focus on studies from the European Alps.},

Wachsende Probleme ergeben sich bei der Roh- stoffgewinnung und bei der Abfallbeseitigung. Der Aufbau der obersten Teile der Geosph{\"{a}}re, ihre Wechselwirkung mit der Atmosph{\"{a}}re und die nat{\"{u}}rliche Stoffzirkulation - das traditionelle Gebiet der Erdwissenschaften - ist bei der L{\"{o}}sung der anstehenden, meist anthropogen verursachten Umweltprobleme von zentraler Bedeutung. Gleichzeitig haben sich die technischen Methoden f{\"{u}}r Beobachtung, Analyse und Sanierung rasch weiterentwickelt. In diese Richtung zielen die an der ETH Z{\"{u}}rich angebotenen Nachdiplomkurse in angewandten Erdwissenschaften. Der erste Teil des Buches handelt ausschliesslich von Hanginstabilit{\"{a}}ten. Im zweiten Teil folgt eine Erweiterung um einige weniger offensichtlichen Gefahrenprozesse, wie die Schadstoffausbreitung in der Geo-, Hydro- und der Atmosph{\"{a}}re und die Beeinflussung von Grundwasserstr{\"{o}}men durch Tunnelbauten. Verkn{\"{u}}pft mit den Grundlagen vermitteln die Beitr{\"{a}}ge einen Ausschnitt gegenw{\"{a}}rtiger Forschung und gew{\"{a}}hren einen Einblick in fach{\"{u}}bergreifende Probleml{\"{o}}sungen aus der Praxis.},

@article{Teich2012,
abstract = {Mountain forests play a crucial role in avalanche control by modifying the snow's mechanical properties. However, snowavalanches do occur in forests due to unfavorable combinations of site, snow and weatherconditions and these so-called ‘forest avalanches' can pose hazard to human settlements and infrastructure. While the meteorological contributory factors of avalanchereleases in open unforested terrain are relatively well understood, much less is known about snow and weatherconditionsassociated with avalanchereleases in forests. In order to identify such critical meteorological situations, we analyzed 21 snow and weather variables of 189 naturally released forest avalanches. By applying a hierarchical clustering method, we distinguished two forest avalanche types: (1) ‘new snow forest avalanches' which release in periods of heavy snowfall and under stormy and permanently cold conditions and (2) ‘old snow forest avalanches' which release after periods of high insolation and an increase in air temperature. Snow and weatherconditions of new snow forest avalanches are rare and clearly distinguishable by classification trees from those of avalanches released in open unforested terrain at similar elevations. We tested for long-term trends in the occurrence of favorable meteorological conditions for forest avalanches during 41 winters (1970/71–2010/11) applying a logistic regression model. The number of potential forest avalanche days decreased at 11 of 14 snow and weather stations in the Swiss Alps for new snow forest avalanches and at 12 of 14 stations for old snow forest avalanches, independent from elevation and climatic region. These negative trends suggest a further decrease of snow and weatherconditionsassociated with avalanchereleases in forests under current climate change and, in combination with the currently observed increase in forest cover density in the Swiss Alps, it is thus likely that avalanchereleases in forested terrain will become less frequent. However, such events will also occur in the future and the presented characterization of meteorological conditions could support avalanche warning and forest services in forecasting forest avalanches.},
