abstract = {Catastrophic partial drainage of Pangong Tso, one of the largest lakes in Tibet, is supported by the geomorphology of the Tangtse Valley, Ladakh, northern India and cosmogenic 10Be nuclide ages of roche moutonn{\'{e}}es, strath terraces, and a flood deposit downstream from the former spillway. The former spillway for Pangong Tso is {\~{}}20-m-high and likely allowed {\~{}}18km3 of water to drain catastrophically down the Tangtse Valley over a period of about 2days sometime during the latest Pleistocene to early Holocene. The largest flood deposit, composed of imbricated granitic boulders up to 4.5m in length, is present {\~{}}33km downvalley of the spillway. These boulders have a cosmogenic 10Be exposure age of 11.1±1.0ka, the age of the outburst flood. The minimum calculated discharge was {\~{}}110,000m3s-1. One set of strath terraces, upvalley of the flood deposit along the flood's drainage path, shows that the rate of fluvial incision 0.3±0.1mmy-1 during 122-10.5ka increased to 1.5±0.5mmy-1 during 10.5ka to the present. The temporal overlap of this increase in the rate of fluvial incision with the main flood deposit suggests that the flood was important in defining the incision along the Tangste valley. A second set of strath terraces shows little change in incision, from {\~{}}0.6-0.9 to {\~{}}0.9-1.4mmy-1, sometime between 18 and 27ka. Roche moutonn{\'{e}}es, upvalley from strath terraces, yield a cosmogenic 10Be age of 35.8±3.0ka, defining the time when glaciers last occupied the Tangtse valley. However, the lack of glacial sediment along the Tangste valley suggests that the flood eroded glacial depositional landforms and sediments resulting in high sediment loads in the floodwater, which in turn increased fluvial incision to form strath terraces. Much of the eroded glacial sediment was subsequently redeposited as the main flood deposit. The catastrophic drainage of Pangong Tso may be the result of breaching of the Pangong-Tangste spillway during very high lake levels in a period of intensified monsoon (10.7-9.6ka) and/or possibly the consequence of seismic activity along the Karakoram Fault that is associated with the initial formation of Pangong Tso. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Field data on the rates of solifluction and associated parameters are compiled from the literature, in an attempt to evaluate factors controlling the spatial variability in solifluctionprocesses and landforms, with special attention on the climate–solifluction relationship. The analyzed data originate from 46 sites over a wide range of periglacial environments, from Antarctic nunataks to tropical high mountains. Solifluction, broadly defined as slow mass wasting resulting from freeze–thaw action in fine-textured soils, involves several components: needle ice creep and diurnal frost creep originating from diurnal freeze–thaw action; annual frost creep, gelifluction and plug-like flow originating from annual freeze–thaw action; and retrograde movement caused by soil cohesion. The depth and thickness of ice lenses and freeze–thaw frequency are the major controls on the spatial variation in solifluctionprocesses. Near the warm margin of the solifluction-affected environment, diurnal freeze–thaw action induces shallow but relatively rapid movement of a superficial layer 5–10 cm thick on average, often creating the thin stone-banked lobes typically seen on tropical high mountains. In addition to diurnal movement, annual frost creep and gelifluction may occur on slopes with soil climates of seasonal frost to warm permafrost, dislocating a soil layer shallower than 60 cm at a rate of centimeters per year and eventually producing medium-size solifluction lobes. In High-Arctic cold permafrost regions, two-sided freezing can induce plug-like flow of a soil mass 60 cm or thicker. The correlation between process and landform suggests that the riser height of lobes is indicative of the maximum depth of movement and prevailing freeze–thaw type. Climate change may result in new different ground freezing conditions, thereby influencing the surface velocity and maximum depth of soil movement. Soil moisture and topography also control solifluction. High moisture availability in the seasonal freezing period enhances diurnal freeze–thaw action and subsequent seasonal frost heaving. The latter contributes to raising the moisture content of the thawed layer and promotes gelifluction during the thawing period. The slope angle defines the upper limit of the surface velocity of solifluction. A diagram correlating the potential frost creep with the actual surface velocity permits an inter-site comparison of the relative magnitude of solifluction components. Physically based modelling of periglacial slope evolution requires synthetic and more detailed field monitoring and laboratory simulations of solifluctionprocesses.},

@article{Teich2012,
abstract = {Mountain forests play a crucial role in avalanche control by modifying the snow's mechanical properties. However, snowavalanches do occur in forests due to unfavorable combinations of site, snow and weatherconditions and these so-called ‘forest avalanches' can pose hazard to human settlements and infrastructure. While the meteorological contributory factors of avalanchereleases in open unforested terrain are relatively well understood, much less is known about snow and weatherconditionsassociated with avalanchereleases in forests. In order to identify such critical meteorological situations, we analyzed 21 snow and weather variables of 189 naturally released forest avalanches. By applying a hierarchical clustering method, we distinguished two forest avalanche types: (1) ‘new snow forest avalanches' which release in periods of heavy snowfall and under stormy and permanently cold conditions and (2) ‘old snow forest avalanches' which release after periods of high insolation and an increase in air temperature. Snow and weatherconditions of new snow forest avalanches are rare and clearly distinguishable by classification trees from those of avalanches released in open unforested terrain at similar elevations. We tested for long-term trends in the occurrence of favorable meteorological conditions for forest avalanches during 41 winters (1970/71–2010/11) applying a logistic regression model. The number of potential forest avalanche days decreased at 11 of 14 snow and weather stations in the Swiss Alps for new snow forest avalanches and at 12 of 14 stations for old snow forest avalanches, independent from elevation and climatic region. These negative trends suggest a further decrease of snow and weatherconditionsassociated with avalanchereleases in forests under current climate change and, in combination with the currently observed increase in forest cover density in the Swiss Alps, it is thus likely that avalanchereleases in forested terrain will become less frequent. However, such events will also occur in the future and the presented characterization of meteorological conditions could support avalanche warning and forest services in forecasting forest avalanches.},

abstract = {Changes in temperature and precipitation have a range of impacts, including change of glacier extent, extent and duration of snow cover, and distribution and thermal properties of permafrost. Similarly, it is likely that climatic changes affect frequency and magnitude of mass movements, such as shallow landslides, debris flows, rock slope failures, or ice avalanches. However, so far changes in mass-movement activity can hardly be detected in observational records. In this progress report we document the role of climate variability and change on mass-movement processes in mountains through the description and analysis of selected, recent mass movements where effects of global warming and the occurrence of heavy precipitation are thought to have contributed to, or triggered, events. In addition, we assess possible effects of future climatic changes on the incidence of mass-movement processes. The report concentrates on high-mountain systems, including processes such as glacier downwasting and the formation of new ice-marginal lakes, glacier debuttressing and the occurrence of rock slope instability, temperature increase and permafrost degradation, as well as on changing sediment reservoirs and sediment supply, with a clear focus on studies from the European Alps.},

@article{Matsuoka1999,
abstract = {Rockfall activity during thawing periods was investigated by collecting rockfall debris fallen on the snow-covered talus slope in a cirque in the Japanese Alps. Near-surface rock temperature was also monitored on the cirque wall. Maximum rockfall activity occurs on average about 10 days after the meltout of the cirque wall. The intensive activity is rarely associated with precipitation events or diurnal frost cycles on the rockface. A thermal conduction model suggests that rockfalls at this site occur most frequently when the seasonal thawing front penetrates to a depth of about 1 m in the bedrock. While the freeze–thaw penetration controls the maximum dimensions of detachable rock mass, joint spacing on the rockface affects the size distribution of rockfall debris. Boulder falls resulting from seasonal frost weathering are considered to be the most important process responsible for the contemporary modification of the cirque wall. The rockfall volume during a thawing period is usually 1–3 m3, which is equivalent to the rate of cirque wall retreat of the order of 0.01 mm year−1. However, big boulder falls that occur once per decade can increase the retreat rate significantly.},

@article{Bolch2011,
abstract = {Like in many other parts of the world, the glaciers in northern Tien Shan are receding, and the permafrost is thawing. Concomitantly, glacial lakes are developing. Historically, outbursts of these glacial lakes have resulted in severe hazards for infrastructures and livelihood. Multi-temporal space imageries are an ideal means to study and monitor glaciers and glacial lakes over large areas. Geomorphometric analysis and modelling allows to estimate the potential danger for glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). This paper presents a comprehensive approach by coupling of remote sensing, geomorphometric analyses aided with GIS modelling for the identification of potentially dangerous glacial lakes. We suggest a classification scheme based on an additive ratio scale in order to prioritise sites for detailed investigations. The identification and monitoring of glacial lakes was carried out semi-automatically using band ratioing and the normalised difference water index (NDWI) based on multi-temporal space imagery from the years 1971 to 2008 using Corona, ASTER and Landsat data. The results were manually edited when required. The probability of the growth of a glacial lake was estimated by analysing glacier changes, glacier motion and slope analysis. A permafrost model was developed based on geomorphometric parameters, solar radiation and regionalised temperature conditions which permitted to assess the influence of potential permafrost thawing. Finally, a GIS-based model was applied to simulate the possibly affected area of lake outbursts. The findings of this study indicate an increasing number and area of glacial lakes in the northern Tien Shan region. We identified several lakes with a medium to high potential for an outburst after a classification according to their outburst probability and their downstream impact. These lakes should be investigated more in detail. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {In den letzten 30 Jahren sind die Nutzungsanspr{\"{u}}che an den knappen verf{\"{u}}gbaren Lebensraum drastisch gestiegen. Wachsende Probleme ergeben sich bei der Roh- stoffgewinnung und bei der Abfallbeseitigung. Der Aufbau der obersten Teile der Geosph{\"{a}}re, ihre Wechselwirkung mit der Atmosph{\"{a}}re und die nat{\"{u}}rliche Stoffzirkulation - das traditionelle Gebiet der Erdwissenschaften - ist bei der L{\"{o}}sung der anstehenden, meist anthropogen verursachten Umweltprobleme von zentraler Bedeutung. Gleichzeitig haben sich die technischen Methoden f{\"{u}}r Beobachtung, Analyse und Sanierung rasch weiterentwickelt. In diese Richtung zielen die an der ETH Z{\"{u}}rich angebotenen Nachdiplomkurse in angewandten Erdwissenschaften. Der erste Teil des Buches handelt ausschliesslich von Hanginstabilit{\"{a}}ten. Im zweiten Teil folgt eine Erweiterung um einige weniger offensichtlichen Gefahrenprozesse, wie die Schadstoffausbreitung in der Geo-, Hydro- und der Atmosph{\"{a}}re und die Beeinflussung von Grundwasserstr{\"{o}}men durch Tunnelbauten. Verkn{\"{u}}pft mit den Grundlagen vermitteln die Beitr{\"{a}}ge einen Ausschnitt gegenw{\"{a}}rtiger Forschung und gew{\"{a}}hren einen Einblick in fach{\"{u}}bergreifende Probleml{\"{o}}sungen aus der Praxis.},

On all investigated active rockglaciers in the Turtmann valley, a distinct acceleration of horizontal velocities has been recorded since the early 1990s. Since variations in rockglacier movement are mainly discussed in the context of temperature fluctuations in the current literature, the link between surface velocities and temperature development is investigated at two different scales. The signal of rockglacier speed-up in the period 1993?2001 (here termed as ?regional signal? since all rockglaciers show this behaviour) fits well with the general increase in air temperature recorded during the 1990s. On the local scale, the pattern of BTS values coincides well with the surface-velocity pattern, but in areas with high velocities the BTS temperatures are clearly below ?3°C. Thus, marginal permafrost occurrence is not indicated in this data and the high velocities probably do not result directly from ?warming? permafrost conditions, as is suggested by other studies.
