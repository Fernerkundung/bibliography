abstract = {The following document is a description of the atmospheric correction algorithm from which the surface reflectances will be calculated for MODIS channels 1 to 7{\^{E}}: 0.648 µm, 0.858 µm, 0.470 µm, 0.555 µm, 1.240 µm, 1.640 µm, and 2.13 µm. The algorithm corrects for the effects of gaseous and aerosol scattering and absorption as well as adjacency effects caused by variation of land cover, Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and atmosphere coupling effects, and contamination by thin cirrus. At launch, the correction of aerosol scattering will be based on aerosol climatology. Climatology will be superseded by MODIS-derived measurements of aerosol optical thickness soon after launch when the MODIS aerosol product has been succesfully evaluated. The correction is achieved by means of a look-up table which provides the transmittances and path radiances for a variety of sun-sensor geometry's and aerosol loadings. This document presents the algorithm theoretical background and an outline of the pre-launch research agenda. This is a working document that will evolve as the research and the product are developed.},
