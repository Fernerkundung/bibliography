abstract = {Since the launch of the first land-observation satellite (Landsat-1) in 1972, land-cover mapping has accumulated a wide range of knowledge in the peer-reviewed literature. However, this knowledge has never been comprehensively analysed for new discoveries. Here, we developed the first spatialized database of scientific literature in English about land-cover mapping. Using this database, we tried to identify the spatial temporal patterns and spatial hotspots of land-cover mapping research around the world. Among other findings, we observed (1) a significant mismatch between hotspot areas of land-cover mapping and areas that are either hard to map or rich in biodiversity; (2) mapping frequency is positively related to economic conditions; (3) there is no obvious temporal trend showing improvement in mapping accuracy; (4) images with more spectral bands or a combination of data types resulted in increased mapping accuracies; (5) accuracy differences due to algorithm differences are not as large as those due ...},

abstract = {Automated monitoring systems that can capture wetlands' high spatial and temporal variability are essential for their management. SAR-based change detection approaches offer a great opportunity to enhance our understanding of complex and dynamic ecosystems. We test a recently-developed time series change detection approach (S1-omnibus) using Sentinel-1 imagery of two wetlands with different ecological characteristics; a seasonal isolated wetland in southern Spain and a coastal wetland in the south of France. We test the S1-omnibus method against a commonly-used pairwise comparison of consecutive images to demonstrate its advantages. Additionally, we compare it with a pairwise change detection method using a subset of consecutive Landsat images for the same period of time. The results show how S1-omnibus is capable of capturing in space and time changes produced by water surface dynamics, as well as by agricultural practices, whether they are sudden changes, as well as gradual. S1-omnibus is capable of detecting a wider array of short-term changes than when using consecutive pairs of Sentinel-1 images. When compared to the Landsat-based change detection method, both show an overall good agreement, although certain landscape changes are detected only by either the Landsat-based or the S1-omnibus method. The S1-omnibus method shows a great potential for an automated monitoring of short time changes and accurate delineation of areas of high variability and of slow and gradual changes.},

abstract = {Forest cover loss and bare ground gain from 2006 to 2010 for the conterminous United States (CONUS) were quantified at a 30m spatial resolution using Web-Enabled Landsat Data available from the USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) (http://landsat.usgs.gov/WELD.php). The approach related multi-temporal WELD metrics and expert-derived training data for forest cover loss and bare ground gain through a decision tree classification algorithm. Forest cover loss was reported at state and ecoregional scales, and the identification of core forests' absent of change was made and verified using LiDAR data from the GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimetry System) instrument. Bare ground gain correlated with population change for large metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) outside of desert or semi-desert environments. GoogleEarth??? time-series images were used to validate the products. Mapped forest cover loss totaled 53,084km2 and was found to be depicted conservatively, with a user's accuracy of 78{\%} and a producer's accuracy of 68{\%}. Excluding errors of adjacency, user's and producer's accuracies rose to 93{\%} and 89{\%}, respectively. Mapped bare ground gain equaled 5974km2 and nearly matched the estimated area from the reference (GoogleEarth???) classification; however, user's (42{\%}) and producer's (49{\%}) accuracies were much less than those of the forest cover loss product. Excluding errors of adjacency, user's and producer's accuracies rose to 62{\%} and 75{\%}, respectively. Compared to recent 2001-2006 USGS National Land Cover Database validation data for forest loss (82{\%} and 30{\%} for respective user's and producer's accuracies) and urban gain (72{\%} and 18{\%} for respective user's and producer's accuracies), results using a single CONUS-scale model with WELD data are promising and point to the potential for national-scale operational mapping of key land cover transitions. However, validation results highlighted limitations, some of which can be addressed by improving training data, creating a more robust image feature space, adding contemporaneous Landsat 5 data to the inputs, and modifying definition sets to account for differences in temporal and spatial observational scales. The presented land cover extent and change data are available via the official WELD website (ftp://weldftp.cr.usgs.gov/CONUS{\_}5Y{\_}LandCover/ftp://weldftp.cr.usgs.gov/CONUS{\_}5Y{\_}LandCover/). ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Better spatial information on the global distribution of croplands and pastures is urgently needed. Without reliable cropland-pasture separation it will be impossible to retrieve high-quality information on agricultural expansion or land use intensification, and on related ecosystem service provision. In this context, the savanna biome is critically important, but information on land use and land cover (LULC) is notoriously inaccurate in these areas. This is due to pronounced spatial-temporal dynamics of agricultural land use and spectral similarities between cropland, pasture, and natural savanna vegetation. In this study, we investigated the potential to reliably separate cropland, pasture, natural savanna vegetation, and other relevant land cover classes employing Landsat-derived spectral-temporal variability metrics for a savanna landscape in the Brazilian Cerrado. In order to better understand the surplus value and limitations of spectral-temporal variability metrics for classification purposes, we analyzed four datasets of different temporal depth, using 344 Landsat scenes across four footprints between 2009 and 2012. Our results showed a reliable separation between cropland, pasture, and natural savanna vegetation achieving an adjusted overall accuracy of 93{\%}. A similar accuracy and spatial consistency of LULC classification could not be achieved based on spectral information alone, indicating the high additional value of temporal information for identifying LULC classes in the complex land use systems of savanna landscapes. There is great potential for transferring our approach to other savanna systems which still suffer from inaccurate LULC information.},
